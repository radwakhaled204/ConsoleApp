# Interview Training Repository

This repository is for **interview training and preparation**, focusing on:

- **C# fundamentals**
- **OOP concepts**
- Basic **problem-solving practice**

It will help me qualify for technical interviews by organizing notes and practicing small exercises clearly and consistently.
